# Backend

This is the backend for BunSamsoa. It's powered by GraphQL, MongoDB and Express.

## Getting the Backend Running
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the repository
3. Run it!

- Running with Docker
```sh
$ docker 
```
- Running without Docker
```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

Calling `npm run start` runs `nodemon`, which live-reloads anytime there's a change to the source files.
